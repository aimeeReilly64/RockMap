<h2 style="color:#3D84C0;">Introduction</h2>
<p>This database is current to <strong>May 9<sup>th</sup>, 2024</strong></p>
<p>The Abandoned Mines information system (AMIS) is a database containing information on known abandoned mine sites and mine hazard features located on both Crown and privately held lands within the province of Ontario. This includes sites that are abandoned, may possibly be in production or may be covered by a closure plan. It also includes sites under Mining Act, Aggregate Resources Act and Federal jurisdictions.</p>
<p>There are currently 6181 known abandoned mine sites under <i>Mining Act</i> jurisdiction scattered throughout the Province, which contain approximately 19,626 mine features.</p>
<p>The original AMIS database compiled in the late 1980s and early 1990s contained basic information on abandoned mine sites and mine hazard features. The Abandoned Mines Program undertook site inspections to assess more than 5000 abandoned mine sites within the province. These site assessments were carried out in 1993 and in 2000 providing further information on the location, access and feature conditions of all mine hazards found on the site. Abandoned Mines Rehabilitation Program staff maintains and updates the AMIS database.</p>
<h2 style="color:#3D84C0;">Methods To View Data</h2>
<p>The <a href=https://www.hub.geologyontario.mines.gov.on.ca>GeologyOntario</a> web page provides access to AMIS database through a quick and effective search engine. Searches can be done by using simple keywords or by using focused searches using Boolean operators. Keywords can include the abandoned mine id, mine name, jurisdiction, and geographic area (township). An overview and description of the search types including Boolean can be found in the <a href=https://www.geologyontario.mndm.gov.on.ca/help.html>Help</a> reference.</p>
<p>The AMIS database can be downloaded from the <a href=https://www.hub.geologyontario.mines.gov.on.ca>GeologyOntario</a> web page. It is available as a packaged product provided in 2 formats: 1) a tabular spreadsheet (Microsoft® xls) format and 2) a geospatial GIS (ESRI® Geodatabase) format.</p>
